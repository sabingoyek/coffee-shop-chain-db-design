# Coffee Shop Chain Database Design

Design relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and to make it easier for executives to make data driven decisions.

Currently their data resides in several different systems: accounting software, suppliersâ€™ databases, point of sales (POS) systems, and even spreadsheets. I will review the data in all of these systems and design a central database to house all of the data. I will then create the database objects and load them with source data. Finally, I will create subsets of data that my business partners require, export them, and then load them into staging databases that use different RDBMS.
